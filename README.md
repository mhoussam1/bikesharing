The graph shows the number of trips per hour. The shades of the colors indicate how many trips. Splitting the genders, we can see that they are very similar to each other. Having almost the same approx. numbers of trips during the day.

This graph shows the number of trips split by the hours of the day and the days of the week. The colors differ in the aspect of if itâ€™s a darker shade it means there are more trips and when it is lighter it indicates fewer trips. From looking at the graph we can tell that the busiest times are in the morning hours on the weekdays from 6 am till 9 am, also showing the busy times in the evening hours between 5 pm and 7 pm. As for the weekends the busiest times are in the middle of the day from 10 am to 6 pm.

The graph shows number of trips by weekday, by also separating it by the user type and gender. Looking at the subscribers we can see that the male has the highest number of trips on Thursdays and Fridays. Females have similar distributions of the trips, but they had less trips in general. As for the unknown gender has uniform distributions throughout the week.
